# Getting Started

### About this project
This project represents a small REST backend for a book-store, exposing several endpoints that are leveraged by it's peer
web app [shopp-web:](https://github.com/Olatunji-Longe/shopp-web).

### Tech Stack/Dependencies
This project utilizes the following technologies;
- Java 8
- Spring Boot (framework)
- Gradle (build tool)
- Embedded H2 (database)
- Liquibase (db migration)
- Caffeine (memory caching)
- Redis (Disabled, but can be optionally turned to replace caffeine for more robust standalone caching)
- A peer front-end application [shopp-web:](https://github.com/Olatunji-Longe/shopp-web) (written in React-16 webhooks) which consumes the APIs exposed by this service
- JUnit (testing)
- REST endpoints

### Execution
- Navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command;

```
    ./gradlew bootRun
```

All of the APIs are accessible via `http://localhost:8090/api/**` if you want to test with a REST client like Postman.
Please see the API documentation here:

   - Schema definitions : http://localhost:8090/api/v3/api-docs/
   - Endpoints: http://localhost:8090/api/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/api/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/
    
    
NOTE - All data exposed by the API endpoints are preloaded on the application's first start up. To reset the data, 
you can simply stop the application, delete the folder named `database` located directly under the root of the application, 
and start the application again. Now, you will be presented with fresh data from scratch.
